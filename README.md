## Overview
This repository contains the full technical implementation and documentation for an AI-driven account prioritization model developed during the RainFocus Business Systems Internship. The goal of the project was to automate the ranking of enterprise accounts based on their likelihood of converting, replacing manual and subjective prioritization methods with a data-driven scoring framework.

The project includes:
- A clean, leakage-free modeling pipeline
- Curated pre-conversion features
- A baseline XGBoost classifier
- End-to-end preprocessing infrastructure
- Detailed technical report in LaTeX/PDF
- Synthetic placeholders for diagrams and datasets (no real corporate data)

This repository remains **private** due to confidentiality constraints.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of the model were:

1. **Automate account prioritization** using statistically sound machine learning.
2. **Integrate multi-source Salesforce-derived data** into a unified feature set.
3. **Prevent temporal leakage** using a strict cutoff-date methodology.
4. **Develop a deployable pipeline** using scikit-learn and XGBoost.
5. **Deliver explainable results** to support sales and marketing strategy decisions.
